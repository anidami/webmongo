Project description:
Hello! This is my assignment 3. This project is a web application developed using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and 
other technologies. The project includes user administration functionalities, NASA API requests to retrieve data about asteroids, 
and the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

NeoWs API: Retrieves data about asteroids passing near Earth.
Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API: Fetches daily astronomy pictures.
NASA API for TimezoneDB: Provides information about the time zones.
Features
User Registration and Authentication: Users can register, authenticate, and log in to explore various features.

User Management: Administrators can view, edit, and delete users. (LOGIN: anida PASSWORD: anidaanidakaa)

Asteroid Information Retrieval: Users can obtain data about asteroids, including closest approach date and miss distance.

Astronomy Picture of the Day: Users can explore daily astronomy pictures with detailed explanations.

Query History: The application stores user query history, capturing queries to NeoWs API and APOD API along with their results.

Technologies and Tools Used
Node.js and Express.js: Backend development.
MongoDB and Mongoose: Storage of user data, asteroid information, astronomy pictures, and query history.
bcryptjs: Hashing user passwords for secure storage and authentication.
Axios: Making HTTP requests to NASA APIs.
dotenv: Loading configuration from the .env file.
ejs: Creating and displaying HTML templates.
body-parser: Processing form data in requests.

Installation and Launch
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
https://github.com/anidami/webmongo.git
2. Install dependencies:
npm install
3. Create a .env file in the project's root directory and add necessary environment variables.
4. Run the application in the terminal of the project folder:
node server.js
5. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

But also you can just open the vercel link with deployment I did.
